# ðŸ“˜ Use Case: HS Course Electives

Highschools offer a vast selection of courses and electives. Many also offer academies and pathways for students to apply to. Once they are accepted, some electives are pre-determined and mandatory. 
I analyzed - with the help of GPT - what options for electives exist at our local HS for students like my oldest, who has interests across an array of subjects.

To simplify and summarize the swaths of information that parents and students have to wade through in order to learn and be successful, not only from a grading standpoint, but to actually **LEARN** and **UNDERSTAND**.
