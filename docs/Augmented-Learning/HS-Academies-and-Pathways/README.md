# ðŸ“˜ Use Case: HS Course Electives

Highschools offer a vast selection of courses and electives. Many also offer academies and pathways for students to apply to. Once they are accepted, some electives are pre-determined and mandatory. 
I worked with ChatGPT to produce an analysis to help students and families have a clear, comprehensive understanding of what such pathways offer, how they may or may not align with college goals, and what alternatives might also be worth considering.

To simplify and summarize the swaths of information that parents and students have to wade through in order to learn and be successful, not only from a grading standpoint, but to actually **LEARN** and **UNDERSTAND**.
