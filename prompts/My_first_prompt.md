## Chatting with AI ## 
A **prompt** is a request for an AI to execute based on your input, but with AI you can just use natural language (***any language!***) to chat with it.

> üó£Ô∏è *You can start with any thought‚Äîeven messy, uncertain, or half-formed. See what it helps you uncover.*
> 
> üó£Ô∏è *You don‚Äôt need the perfect question. Just start typing what‚Äôs on your mind.*
> 
> üó£Ô∏è *If you write your own prompts, remember that it is **not important** to consider line breaks or a certain prompt format,*
*but you can structure it for readability, especially on mobile.*
>
> üó£Ô∏è *You can have everything in one line if you like.*
> 
> üó£Ô∏è *This is natural language processing. That means* ***you can talk to it like you would talk to an actual person. It understands you!***
> 
> üó£Ô∏è *No "commands" or "formal requests" need to be issued.*
> 
> üó£Ô∏è ***Just talk to it.***
